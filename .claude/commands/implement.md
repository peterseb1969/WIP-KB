Execute Phase 3 (Implementation) of the AI-Assisted Development process.

### Prerequisites
Phase 2 must be complete with **explicit user approval** of the data model.
The WIP MCP server must be connected.

### Before Any MCP Calls
Read `docs/WIP_PoNIFs.md` — the 8 PoNIFs describe non-intuitive WIP behaviours that will cause silent failures if you rely on conventional assumptions. Pay special attention to:
- PoNIF #2: Template update does NOT replace the old version — both stay active
- PoNIF #3: Identity fields control create-vs-update via hash — get them wrong and versioning breaks silently
- PoNIF #4: Bulk API returns 200 OK even when items fail — check per-item results
- PoNIF #7: Edge types are templates with `usage: "relationship"` — different validation, different query endpoints; reference fields must be named exactly `source_ref` and `target_ref`
- PoNIF #8: `versioned: false` edge types overwrite in place — no version history

### Steps — Strict Order, Using MCP Tools

#### Step 1: Create terminologies
For each terminology in the approved data model:
- Check if it already exists: `list_terminologies` — if found, skip creation
- Create the terminology: `create_terminology(value, label, description)`
- Create all terms: `create_terms(terminology_id, [{value, label, aliases, description}, ...])`
- Verify: `list_terms(terminology_id)` — confirm all terms are present
- **If the data model specifies ontology relations** (hierarchical terminologies):
  - Create relations: `create_relations([{source_term_id, target_term_id, relation_type}, ...])`
  - Relation types: is_a, part_of, has_part, regulates, positively_regulates, negatively_regulates
  - Verify: `get_term_hierarchy(term_id, direction="children")` — confirm the hierarchy is correct
  - For bulk ontology loading, use `import_terminology` with OBO Graph JSON format
- Log: record the terminology ID and value

#### Step 2: Create templates (referenced entities first)
For each template, in dependency order (referenced before referencing):
- Create the template: `create_template({value, label, fields, identity_fields, ...})`
  - Use draft mode (`status: "draft"`) if there are circular dependencies
  - After all drafts are created: `activate_template(template_id)` — cascading validation
- Verify: `get_template_fields(template_value)` — confirm all fields, identity fields, and references are correct
- Log: record the template ID, value, and version

#### Step 3: Test with a single document
For each template:
- Create ONE test document: `create_document(document)` — pass `template_version` explicitly
- Verify: confirm the document was created with correct document_id and identity hash
- Test versioning: call `create_document` with the SAME identity fields but a changed non-identity field. Verify version increments to 2.
- Test validation: call `create_document` with invalid data (bad term value, missing mandatory field). Verify a clear validation error is returned.
- Test references: create a referencing document pointing to the first. Verify the reference resolves.

#### Step 4: Test file operations (if applicable)
- Upload a test file: `upload_file(file_path)`
- Create a document linking to the file ID
- Verify: `get_file_metadata(file_id)` — confirm file is referenced

#### Step 5: Clean up or keep test data
Ask the user whether to keep or archive the test documents.

#### Step 6: Summary
Present a summary:
- Terminologies created (with IDs and values) — distinguish new vs. reused
- Templates created (with IDs, values, and versions)
- Test results: all pass / any failures with details
- Ready for Phase 4 (Application Layer)

### Error Handling
If any MCP tool call fails:
- Do NOT continue to the next step
- Report the exact error returned by the MCP tool
- Diagnose: is it a data model issue (go back to Phase 2) or a WIP issue (investigate)?
- Ask the user how to proceed

### Transition to Phase 4
Once Phase 3 is complete and verified, the development-time work with MCP tools is done. Phase 4 shifts to writing application code that uses `@wip/client` and `@wip/react` at runtime. Read `docs/WIP_DevGuardrails.md` before proceeding.
