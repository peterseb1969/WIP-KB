# Case Workflow Playbook

Handler reference for the `/wip-case` slash command. The command reads this file
and dispatches on `$ARGUMENTS`.

**Cases live in the KB, not on disk.** There are no `yac-discussions/CASE-*.md`
files to scan, rename, or stage — the KB is the record. Every read and write goes
through the **served KB client** (`case-fetch.py` to read, `kb-write.py` to write),
which talks only to the KB **gateway** (never the document-store backend).

## Subcommands

- `/wip-case file [Peter comment]` — file a new case (bug, question, request, gap)
- `/wip-case list` — list open/responded cases
- `/wip-case read <n>` — read a case in full (body + all responses)
- `/wip-case respond <n>` — append a response (drives open→responded)
- `/wip-case comment <n>` — add a comment (any state; no transition)
- `/wip-case close <n>` — close without implementing (won't-fix / not-an-issue / deferred)
- `/wip-case implement <n>` — apply the proposed patch, then close as implemented

## Prerequisites

A session ID (see YAC Reporting in CLAUDE.md).

## The served KB client (one-time, self-refreshing)

Fetched from the running instance — version-matched, no FR-YAC dependency. Inputs
are the instance URL + your API key (both from `.claude/kb.json`):

```bash
curl -fsSk -H "X-API-Key: $(cat "$(python3 -c 'import json;print(json.load(open(".claude/kb.json"))["kb_api_key_file"])')")" \
  "$(python3 -c 'import json;print(json.load(open(".claude/kb.json"))["kb_app_url"])')/apps/kb/server-api/kb-client/install" | sh
```

That materializes the bundle into `~/.cache/wip-kb-client/` and writes the stable
`kbc` shim to `~/.local/bin/kbc`. Everything below runs through `kbc`; the runner
behind it self-refreshes when the instance's bundle digest changes and restores a
missing shim on every invocation:

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py …    # reads
kbc kb-write.py …      # writes
```

If `kbc` does not resolve, re-run the install one-liner — that is the whole
recovery. (The bootstrap curl stays long-form deliberately: it runs before `kbc`
can exist.)

**One write surface.** All writes are `kb-write.py <TYPE> …` → the gateway's single
`POST /write/:type`. The gateway allocates the `case_number` + claims the `CASE-<n>`
synonym, scoped `CASE-<n>#<seq>` for responses, and persists edges. Status-transition
*validity* is enforced here in the playbook (compose only a legal transition); the
gateway is pure persistence.

Legal transitions: `open → {responded, closed, implemented}`,
`responded → {closed, implemented}`; `closed` / `implemented` are terminal.

## `/wip-case file`

1. **Time:** `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'`.
2. **Compose `case.md`** — frontmatter keys are CASE_RECORD fields; the markdown
   after the fence becomes the case body:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: <short case title>
   authored_by: <your session ID>
   filed_by: <your session ID>
   doc_status: published
   status: open
   type: <bug | question | request | platform-gap>
   severity: <blocks-me | annoying | fyi>
   component: <wip-client | document-store | registry | scaffold | mcp-server | wip-react | wip-proxy | wip-auth | reporting-sync | other>
   app: <your app name, or "backend">
   target_yac: <FRanC | BE-YAC | any>
   ---

   ## Problem
   <what happened, with evidence — errors, behaviour, missing functionality;
   specific enough for a YAC with no knowledge of your app.>

   ## Expected
   <what should have happened.>

   ## Workaround
   <what you're doing meanwhile, or "None" if blocked.>

   ## Peter's Take
   <verbatim, only if Peter gave a comment with /wip-case file; else omit.>
   ```

3. **File it** (the gateway mints `case_number` + the `CASE-<n>` synonym; link any
   related cases as REFERENCES edges):

   ```bash
   kbc kb-write.py CASE_RECORD case.md --edge REFERENCES:CASE_RECORD:12 --edge REFERENCES:CASE_RECORD:340
   # -> created CASE-<n> (<document_id>)  edges: REFERENCES→12=linked, …
   ```

4. **Confirm:** tell Peter the case number + document_id.

---

## `/wip-case list`

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py list --status open,responded
# facets: --status (comma list) --filed-by --severity --type --component --app  --format table|json
```

APP-YACs: filter to your app (`--app <name>`) or cases you filed (`--filed-by <id>`).
BE-YACs: list all. If none, say "No cases" and stop.

---

## `/wip-case read <n>`

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py case <n>                    # body + full response thread (default: view=both)
kbc case-fetch.py case <n> --view case        # case body only
kbc case-fetch.py case <n> --view responses   # the response thread only
kbc case-fetch.py case <n> --response latest  # just the latest response
kbc case-fetch.py case <n> --response <seq>   # a specific response (404 if absent)
kbc case-fetch.py case <n> --format json      # raw gateway payload
```

Prints the case body followed by its responses (CASE_RESPONSE docs, seq-ordered,
active-only) — one gateway read, no separate fetch. Backed by
`GET /cases/:n?view=both|case|responses[&response=latest|<seq>]`. If the case (or an
explicit `--response <seq>`) isn't found, tell Peter and stop.

---

## `/wip-case respond <n>`

**Analyse before responding — do not jump to implementation.**
1. Understand the root cause from the source, not the symptom.
2. Don't assume the filer's proposed fix is correct — check it against the platform
   (validation rules, identity scoping, bulk contracts, edge cases). Propose a better
   one if warranted, and say why.
3. If the proposed fix IS right, say so and show the analysis.
   (CASE-50 was implemented blindly and broke; CASE-36 was analysed properly. Be CASE-36.)

Then, two writes — the response doc + the status transition:

```bash
# 1) the response (compose response.md: body markdown; frontmatter sets the fields)
#    response.md frontmatter: case_number: <n> / response_kind: respond / author: <id> / doc_status: published
kbc kb-write.py CASE_RESPONSE response.md --edge RESPONDS_TO:CASE_RECORD:<n>
# -> created CASE-<n>#<seq>  edges: RESPONDS_TO→<n>=linked

# 2) drive open → responded (only if currently open)
kbc kb-write.py CASE_RECORD --patch status=responded --match case_number=<n>
```

Confirm the case number + new status to Peter.

---

## `/wip-case comment <n>`

A comment is a CASE_RESPONSE with `response_kind: comment` and **no** status change
(legal in any state, including terminal):

```bash
kbc kb-write.py CASE_RESPONSE comment.md --edge RESPONDS_TO:CASE_RECORD:<n>
# comment.md frontmatter: case_number: <n> / response_kind: comment / author: <id> / doc_status: published
```

---

## `/wip-case close <n>`

Close without implementing (won't-fix / not-an-issue / deferred / handled manually).
Compose the resolution rationale, then response + transition:

```bash
kbc kb-write.py CASE_RESPONSE close.md --edge RESPONDS_TO:CASE_RECORD:<n>
#   close.md frontmatter: case_number: <n> / response_kind: close / author: <id> / doc_status: published
kbc kb-write.py CASE_RECORD --patch status=closed --match case_number=<n>
```

Terminal. Tell Peter it's closed and why.

---

## `/wip-case implement <n>`

The "do the work" command. Read the case (`case-fetch.py case <n>`); if it has no
proposed fix, tell Peter to `/wip-case respond` first and stop.

1. **Verify the proposed fix before touching code** — does the analysis convince you?
   Has the target code changed since the response? Side effects on other callers/tests?
   If anything is wrong, respond with your findings instead of implementing a fix you
   don't trust.
2. **Apply each change**; if quoted "current text" no longer matches, flag and skip it.
3. **Show the diff** (`git diff`) and let Peter review before committing.
4. **Record + close:**

   ```bash
   kbc kb-write.py CASE_RESPONSE implement.md --edge RESPONDS_TO:CASE_RECORD:<n>
   #   implement.md frontmatter: case_number: <n> / response_kind: implement / author: <id> / doc_status: published
   kbc kb-write.py CASE_RECORD --patch status=implemented --match case_number=<n>
   ```

Terminal. Tell Peter what was applied and that the case is implemented.

---

## Full-text search — find by content (CASE-707)

Every verb above filters on values you already know. This is the "which docs mention
X" surface, across the **whole corpus** — `kb` and `library` are searched as one and
merged. Backed by `GET /search`, which fronts the platform's reporting-sync FTS
(Postgres tsvector, ranked, with snippets).

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py search "reporting-sync"
kbc case-fetch.py search "flag dispatch" --type CASE_RECORD
kbc case-fetch.py search "restore" --mode substring --limit 50
#   --type   restrict to one doc type (CASE_RECORD, FIRESIDE, LESSON, DOCUMENT, …)
#   --mode   auto (default) | fts | substring — auto falls back to substring when
#            FTS finds nothing
#   --limit  max hits (default 25, cap 100); output flags when it truncated
#   --format table|json
```

Results carry type, relevance score, title, a snippet, and the document_id — follow up
with `case <n>` / `fireside <n>` / `read <TYPE>` to pull the full doc. Exit 1 when
nothing matched.

**Use this instead of dropping to reporting SQL.** Raw SQL bypasses the gateway (and
targets whichever instance your env points at); this stays on the same gateway as every
other verb.

---

## Reading any KB type — generic typed read (CASE-683)

Read/write parity: every doc type `kb-write.py` can write is readable through one
generic verb, symmetric to the single `POST /write/:type` write surface. Backed by
`GET /read/:type`. Use this for the writable types that have no bespoke read verb
(`YAC_MEMORY`, `LESSON`, `DESIGN_DECISION`, `GIT_STATS_SNAPSHOT`,
`BOOTSTRAP_RECORD`, `DOCUMENT`, …); the dedicated verbs above (`case`, `list`,
`fireside`, `library`, `journey`) are richer where they exist.

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py read <TYPE> [--filter KEY=VALUE …]
#   TYPE        — the doc type value, e.g. YAC_MEMORY, LESSON, DESIGN_DECISION, DOCUMENT
#   --filter    — repeatable; each KEY=VALUE is an eq-match on data.KEY, so a type's
#                 identity fields filter for free
#   --namespace — override the type's home namespace (default: its home)
#   --page / --page-size — paginate (default page 1, 50 rows/page, cap 100)
#   --format table|json  — default table

kbc case-fetch.py read LESSON --filter owner=FRanC
kbc case-fetch.py read GIT_STATS_SNAPSHOT --filter repo=WIP-KB --filter snapshot_date=2026-07-18
kbc case-fetch.py read YAC_MEMORY --format json
```

Exit 1 if the type is unknown or has no read route; exit 2 on transport failure.

---

## Edges — attach and inspect cross-links (CASE-630)

Cross-links live in the graph, not in prose. A response that concerns another
case gets a REFERENCES edge (CASE_RESPONSE is an allowed source since CASE-630).

**Attach an edge between two EXISTING docs** — the sanctioned retry for a
failed edge intent; never re-post the document:

```bash
kbc kb-write.py EDGE REFERENCES CASE-629#1 CASE-627
# handles = Registry synonyms (CASE-<n>, CASE-<n>#<seq>, session ids) or document_ids
# idempotent: KB edge types are versioned:false, identity [source_ref, target_ref]
```

**Inspect a doc's edges** (both directions, far end labeled with its doc type):

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py edges CASE-626
kbc case-fetch.py edges CASE-626#1
```

**Failed edge intents on a doc write no longer abort the request.** The write
returns the doc result plus per-edge status (`linked` / `target_not_found` /
`error`); `kb-write.py` exits **3** when the doc persisted but an edge intent
was rejected — retry ONLY the edge with the EDGE verb above. Exit 2 remains
transport failure; a `target_not_found` intent stays exit 0 (the loaders'
converge-on-rewrite semantics).

---

## Flags — the deterministic dispatch queue (flag-for-YAC)

Peter flags a doc in the UI → a FLAG_RECORD (target_yac, flag_type) plus a
FLAGGED_FROM edge. A deterministic poller turns pending flags into sub-agent
dispatches:

```bash
kbc case-fetch.py flags --target-yac FRanC --target-type CASE_RECORD --format json
# rows carry flag_id + target.case_number — everything a dispatcher needs
```

**Lifecycle contract:** `doc_status: published` = pending dispatch (the
default filter). After dispatching, mark the flag consumed so the poller
never re-triggers it:

```bash
kbc kb-write.py FLAG_RECORD --patch doc_status=dispatched --match document_id=<flag_id>
```

(`document_id` match is the escape hatch for composite-identity types —
FLAG_RECORD's identity is `[flag_type, flagged_document]`.) Re-flagging the
same doc in the UI upserts that identity back to `published`, which re-arms
the trigger after a failed run. `--doc-status dispatched` / `all` list
consumed / every flag.
