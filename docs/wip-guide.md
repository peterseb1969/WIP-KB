# WIP Guide

The operator-facing guide for installing, securing, and running World In a Pie. If you are deploying WIP, configuring auth or networking, packaging an app to run alongside it, or hardening a production install — this is your one stop.

> **Audience.** You have a target host with Podman (or Kubernetes) installed and want WIP up and useful. You are comfortable with the shell, podman/docker, and editing config files. You do not need to read the codebase to follow this guide. Host-prep advice (Pi SSD setup, macOS Podman machine sizing, cloud VM specs) lives in the [single-host quickstart's Host prep appendix](deploy/podman/README.md#appendix-host-prep-pi-ssd-podman-sizing).

For the *why* — design philosophy, theses, use cases — see [Vision](Vision.md) and the FAQ section in the [README](../README.md). For the data model and APIs, see [api-conventions.md](api-conventions.md), [data-models.md](data-models.md), and the MCP `wip://` resources.

---

## 1. Quick Start

> **Prefer a guided, validated walkthrough?** Pick your target:
> **[single-host — podman + GHCR images](deploy/podman/README.md)** · **[hot-reload dev — local source](deploy/dev/README.md)** · **[Kubernetes](deploy/k8s/README.md)**.
> Building an app on WIP → **[APP-YAC setup tutorial](app-yac-tutorial.md)**. The commands below are the condensed operator reference underneath those guides.

### Install (compose)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterseb1969/World-in-a-Pie.git
cd World-in-a-Pie

# Recommended default. Generates manifests + .env, brings the stack up.
wip-deploy install --preset standard --target compose --hostname wip.local
```

What this gives you:

- The eight WIP services: the four core data services (Registry, Def-Store, Template-Store, Document-Store), Auth-Gateway (sits in front for API-key + JWT validation), Reporting-Sync (PostgreSQL projection), Ingest-Gateway (async bulk via NATS, enabled by preset), and the MCP Server (when included via the preset)
- The supporting infrastructure: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NATS, Garage, Dex, Caddy
- HTTPS via Caddy on port 8443 (internal/self-signed by default)
- A starter API key written to the secrets backend

After the install completes, the console is at `https://<hostname>:8443/`.

### Verify

```bash
# Health via Caddy
curl -k https://<hostname>:8443/api/registry/health

# Each service direct (when reachable from your host)
curl http://<hostname>:8001/health    # Registry
curl http://<hostname>:8002/health    # Def-Store
curl http://<hostname>:8003/health    # Template-Store
curl http://<hostname>:8004/health    # Document-Store
curl http://<hostname>:8005/health    # Reporting-Sync (when enabled)
curl http://<hostname>:8006/health    # Ingest-Gateway (when enabled)
```

Aggregated check via the toolkit:

```bash
wip-toolkit status
wip-toolkit status --json    # for piping into automation
wip-toolkit status --integrity   # adds the heavy referential-integrity scan
```

### Deployment targets and presets

`wip-deploy install` accepts three targets and five presets.

| Target | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `compose` | production-style local install, podman-compose / docker-compose under the hood (the default) |
| `dev` | hot-reload local development, with optional `--app-source NAME=PATH` to bind-mount one app from a checkout |
| `k8s` | Kubernetes manifests via the same deployer spec |

| Preset | What it includes |
|---|---|
| `headless` | API services only, no UI |
| `core` | + console + API keys |
| `analytics` | + OIDC (Dex) + reporting-sync + Postgres |
| `standard` (default) | + Garage + MCP server — fully exercisable platform |
| `full` | + ingest-gateway (async bulk via NATS JetStream) |

You can amend a preset with `--add <module>` and `--remove <module>`. Apps (e.g., `react-console`, `clintrial`) are enabled per-install with `--app <name>` or, in dev mode, `--app-source <name>=<path>`.

> **Legacy paths.** v1's `scripts/setup.sh` and `scripts/setup-wip.sh` were retired and **deleted**; only `wip-deploy` ships today. Older external docs may still reference them — ignore those references and use `wip-deploy` for all installs.

---

## 2. Deployment Tiers

Three security tiers cover the realistic deployment ranges.

| Tier | Use case | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 — Home Pi** | Local network, trusted users | Random secrets, self-signed TLS (`--tls internal`), single API key |
| **Tier 2 — Internet-exposed** | Public access, multiple users | Let's Encrypt (`--tls letsencrypt`), per-service / per-app API keys, NATS and MongoDB authentication (per-service users). |
| **Tier 3 — Enterprise** | High-security requirements | External secrets manager, mTLS, enterprise OIDC. WIP is wired for these but does not ship a turnkey enterprise install today. |

This guide focuses on Tier 1 and Tier 2 — the ones you can stand up with the bundled tooling.

### Tier 1: Home Pi

```bash
wip-deploy install \
  --preset standard \
  --target compose \
  --hostname wip-pi.local \
  --tls internal
```

What you should know:

- TLS is self-signed (Caddy generates and rotates the cert in `<data-dir>/caddy/`). Browsers will prompt you to accept the cert once.
- Random secrets are generated and stored in the secrets backend (default file backend at `~/.wip-deploy/<install-name>/secrets/`, mode `0600`, directory mode `0700`).
- A single starter API key is created. You can promote it to per-service keys later (see §4 *Authentication*).

### Tier 2: Internet-exposed

```bash
wip-deploy install \
  --preset standard \
  --target compose \
  --hostname wip.example.com \
  --tls letsencrypt
```

What changes:

- Let's Encrypt issues a real cert via Caddy. You need port 443 reachable from the public internet for the ACME HTTP-01 challenge, and a hostname that resolves on the public internet.
- HSTS and standard hardening headers (nosniff, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy) are included in the rendered Caddy config for letsencrypt installs — `wip-deploy verify --security` confirms them.
- For testing the ACME flow without burning rate limits, use `--tls letsencrypt --acme-staging` (staging cert is *not* trusted by browsers).
- Run `wip-deploy verify --security` and walk the §7 *Security Hardening* checklist before exposing the host.

### Tier 3: Enterprise

WIP's architecture is enterprise-grade in design (OIDC, namespace isolation, audit trails, controlled vocabularies, federation-ready identity), but the productisation is not there yet — there is no commercial support, SLA, or turnkey enterprise installer. Pieces you would extend for an enterprise install:

- **Secrets:** swap the file backend for a `k8s-secret` backend (built in) or wire a Vault/KMS integration (custom).
- **OIDC:** replace Dex with your enterprise IdP (any OIDC-compliant provider works).
- **TLS:** terminate at your edge, run WIP behind it with `--tls external`.
- **HA:** MongoDB replica sets, PostgreSQL replication, multi-instance services. WIP doesn't ship HA today; the architecture allows it.

---

## 3. Network Configuration

Networking is where most operator failures happen. The three callouts below prevent the most expensive ones.

### 3.1 Critical: `--hostname` is the OIDC issuer

> **The hostname and HTTPS port you install with become Dex's issuer URL, and every token's `iss` claim. Choose them once, as the name browsers will actually use.**
>
> `wip-deploy` derives all of a service's token-validation settings from that one value, so they cannot drift apart. Never set them by hand: every apply re-renders them.
>
> | Setting | Rendered as | Example |
> |---|---|---|
> | Dex `issuer:` (rendered `config/dex/config.yaml`) | `https://<hostname>[:<https_port>]/dex` | `https://wip-pi.local:8443/dex` |
> | Services' `WIP_AUTH_JWT_ISSUER_URL` | the same public URL; it is compared against the token's `iss` | `https://wip-pi.local:8443/dex` |
> | Services' `WIP_AUTH_JWT_JWKS_URI` | Dex's internal address, because services fetch signing keys server-to-server | `http://wip-dex:5556/dex/keys` |
> | Services' `WIP_AUTH_JWT_AUDIENCE` | every Dex client the deployment registers: the gateway's, plus each app that declares its own | `wip-gateway,dnd` |
>
> Dex sets a token's `aud` to the client that requested it. That is why the audience is a list: a token minted for an app's own client is as valid as the gateway's. A key endpoint that can't be reached refuses the request with 503; a token with the wrong issuer or audience gets 401.
>
> **To change the hostname**, re-install with the new `--hostname`. The issuer is also baked into the TLS certificate and every registered redirect URI, and tokens minted under the old issuer stop validating.

### 3.2 Critical: Caddy `handle` vs `handle_path`

> **`handle` preserves the request path; `handle_path` strips the matched prefix.** Picking the wrong one produces silent routing errors.
>
> ```caddyfile
> # CORRECT — service receives /api/def-store/terminologies
> handle /api/def-store/* {
>     reverse_proxy wip-def-store:8002
> }
>
> # WRONG — service receives /terminologies, returns 404
> handle_path /api/def-store/* {
>     reverse_proxy wip-def-store:8002
> }
> ```
>
> WIP services mount under `/api/<svc>/` and expect to see the full path. **Use `handle`.**
>
> **The object-store carve-out.** Garage's S3 API serves at the root of its own URL space, so the deployer routes `/garage/<bucket>/<key>` to Garage with `handle_path` to *strip* the `/garage/` prefix, and restores the upstream Host header (SigV4-presigned URLs are signed against the internal endpoint's Host). This is in the deployer's generated config; you generally don't edit it by hand.

### 3.3 Critical: Caddy returns 200 + empty body on unmatched paths

> **An unmatched path under a Caddy server block does not 404 by default — it returns HTTP 200 with an empty body.** This bites health checks and routing diagnosis hard:
>
> - A monitoring script that probes `/health` on a service that isn't actually routed gets `200 + ""` and parses the empty body as "valid JSON, value is null" or similar — the failure is silent.
> - "Service is healthy" can mean "Caddy is reachable, but nothing is handling this path."
>
> Always validate health endpoints by **content**, not just status code. And when a route looks broken, treat empty 200 as a route-miss until proved otherwise.

### 3.4 Four deployment scenarios

| # | Scenario | Console | API | Dex |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Localhost + OIDC | `https://localhost:8443/` | via Caddy on `:8443` | `https://localhost:8443/dex` |
| 2 | Localhost − OIDC | `http://localhost:3000/` | direct on `:8001`–`:8006` | n/a |
| 3 | Remote + OIDC | `https://<host>:8443/` | via Caddy on `:8443` | `https://<host>:8443/dex` |
| 4 | Remote − OIDC | `http://<host>:3000/` | direct on `:8001`–`:8006` | n/a |

Choose by what you need. If you want auth, go with 1 or 3 (and pick `--hostname` deliberately — it becomes the OIDC issuer, §3.1). If you want absolute simplicity for local hacking, scenarios 2 and 4 use API keys only and skip Caddy entirely (services bind to their direct ports, console is on `:3000`).

For scenarios 2 and 4 the console's dev server needs proxy rules (Vite `vite.config.ts → server.proxy`) pointing `/api/registry`, `/api/def-store`, etc. at the matching `localhost:800x`.

## 4. Authentication

### 4.1 Two layers: API auth vs database auth

WIP has two independent authentication concerns:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Client ──── API auth ────► WIP service ──── DB auth ───► MongoDB    │
│              (this guide)                  (MONGO_URI)               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **API auth** — how clients (browser, scripts, other services) prove identity to WIP's REST API. This is what the rest of this section covers.
- **DB auth** — how WIP services connect to MongoDB / PostgreSQL / NATS internally. Configured via connection strings (`MONGO_URI`, etc.); NATS and MongoDB credentials are per-service users the deployer generates and injects (`NATS_USER` / `NATS_PASSWORD`, `MONGO_USER` / `MONGO_PASSWORD`). It is independent of API auth and not affected by anything below.

### 4.2 API auth modes

The `WIP_AUTH_MODE` env var picks the mode. `dual` is recommended.

| Mode | Description | When |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Anything goes | Local dev only |
| `api_key_only` | Static / runtime API keys | Service-to-service, scripts, simple setups |
| `jwt_only` | OIDC JWTs only | Pure user-facing apps |
| `dual` (recommended) | Accepts both | Mixed: real users *and* service accounts |

API keys are sent as `X-API-Key: <key>`. JWTs are sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### 4.3 API keys: config keys vs runtime keys

WIP supports two kinds of API keys; both authenticate identically.

| Aspect | Config keys | Runtime keys |
|---|---|---|
| Defined in | `config/api-keys.json` | MongoDB, via REST API |
| Created by | Declared in the deployment spec (`--api-key`, below) or by editing the file + recreating services | `POST /api/registry/api-keys` |
| Modifiable via API | No (read-only) | Yes |
| Deletable via API | No | Yes |
| Survives a MongoDB wipe/restore | **Yes** — material lives in the spec + secret backend | **No** — key and grants are Mongo rows; the plaintext is unrecoverable |
| Use case | Bootstrap keys, service accounts, agent keys that must survive redeploys | App keys, temporary keys, UI-created keys |
| `source` field on the key | `"config"` | `"runtime"` |

**Spec-declared keys (recommended for standing agent/service keys).**
Declare keys on the deployment and wip-deploy provisions everything:

```bash
wip-deploy install --target dev \
  --api-key '{"name": "web-yac", "namespaces": ["library", "kb"], "grants": {"kb": "write"}}'
```

For each declared key the deployer generates a random plaintext into the
install's secret backend (`~/.wip-deploy/<name>/secrets/<key>-api-key`,
stable across re-applies), renders `config/auth/api-keys.json` (mode
0600), and mounts it into every backend service. `namespaces` is the
key's read scope; `grants` gives per-namespace `read`/`write`/`admin`
and must stay within `namespaces`. Crucially, a spec-declared key's
grants resolve **locally in wip-auth** — not via Registry grants in
MongoDB — so the key keeps working, at full declared scope, after any
Mongo rebuild (redeploy with a fresh volume, `nuke --remove-data`, or
the wipe-and-restore remediation ritual). Runtime keys die in exactly
those events, and backups do not cover them. The declaration persists
in the install's state: plain `redeploy`/`rebuild` keep it.

Several keys are more comfortably declared in a file than in repeated
`--api-key` JSON — reviewable and diffable deployer input:

```bash
wip-deploy install --api-keys-file keys.yaml
# keys.yaml: a list under a top-level `keys:` (or a bare list) —
# each entry {name, namespaces, grants, owner?, groups?}.
# File entries merge with any --api-key values.
```

Rotate a declared key in place with `wip-deploy rotate-key <name>`: the
key's secret is regenerated, the spec re-applied — restarting the
services that read the key — and the fresh plaintext printed exactly
once. No grace window — the old plaintext stops working at apply;
external holders must be re-handed it. (Runtime keys can't rotate in
place — revoke + create. All key kinds: §7.2.)

### 4.4 Runtime API keys: CRUD endpoints

```bash
# Create
curl -k -X POST https://<host>:8443/api/registry/api-keys \
  -H "X-API-Key: <admin-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-app",
    "owner": "peter",
    "namespaces": ["production"],
    "description": "My app"
  }'
```

The response contains `plaintext_key` exactly **once**. Save it then. WIP stores only a bcrypt hash; lose the plaintext and you must revoke and recreate.

```bash
# List (config + runtime), no plaintext exposed
curl -k -H "X-API-Key: <admin-key>" https://<host>:8443/api/registry/api-keys

# Get a single key
curl -k -H "X-API-Key: <admin-key>" https://<host>:8443/api/registry/api-keys/my-app

# Update metadata (PATCH; only fields you include change)
curl -k -X PATCH https://<host>:8443/api/registry/api-keys/my-app \
  -H "X-API-Key: <admin-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"groups": ["wip-users"], "enabled": false}'

# Revoke
curl -k -X DELETE https://<host>:8443/api/registry/api-keys/my-app \
  -H "X-API-Key: <admin-key>"
```

Other services discover key changes via the Registry's `/api/registry/api-keys/sync` endpoint, polled every 30 seconds. After creating or revoking a key, allow up to 30 seconds for non-Registry services to pick up the change.

### 4.5 Namespace scoping and privileged groups

API keys carry a `namespaces` field that scopes their access. The rule is:

- **Privileged groups** — `wip-admins` and `wip-services` — are exempt from namespace scoping. A key in either group has access across all namespaces.
- **Every other key** must declare `namespaces` explicitly. Non-privileged keys without a namespace scope receive 403 on every request.
- **Single-namespace keys** get a convenience: omit the `namespace` query parameter and the server derives it from the key's scope. Multi-namespace keys must always pass `namespace` explicitly.

### 4.6 External identity providers (Google, Okta, …) — not supported yet

Dex can federate logins from external providers through its *connectors*, but
`wip-deploy` has no way to declare one yet: it renders Dex's config with an
empty connector list. Every apply rewrites that file, including `redeploy`,
`add-app`, `rotate-key` and `user add`. It also rewrites `.env`, which never
reaches the Dex container anyway. A hand-added connector therefore disappears
silently on the next apply. Until spec-level support lands, local Dex users
(§4.7) are the supported way to log in.

When support lands, the Google side is unchanged. Create a *Web application*
OAuth client in Google Cloud Console with the redirect URI
`https://<your-hostname>:8443/dex/callback`, and pick **Internal** consent for
Workspace-only users. External users also need a route into WIP groups,
otherwise per-app group gates keep them out.

### 4.7 Local users (Dex static users)

The local-account logins on the Dex screen are **spec configuration**: the
install's `auth.users` list, declared once and rendered on every apply,
the same model as the spec-declared API keys in §4.3. Every install starts
with three:

| Email | Username | Group |
|---|---|---|
| `admin@wip.local` | `admin` | `wip-admins` |
| `editor@wip.local` | `editor` | `wip-editors` |
| `viewer@wip.local` | `viewer` | `wip-viewers` |

Each user's password is generated into the install's secret backend as
`dex-password-<username>` and stays stable across re-applies. On the file
backend that is `~/.wip-deploy/<name>/secrets/dex-password-<username>`; on
k8s it is the `dex-password-<username>` key of the `wip-secrets` Secret.

Add, remove and list users with `wip-deploy user`:

```bash
# Declare a user and apply; the password is printed once and kept in the secret backend
wip-deploy user add e2e --email e2e@wip.local --group wip-editors --name <install>

# What's declared, and whether each password secret exists yet
wip-deploy user list --name <install>

# Remove a user: logins stop at apply, and the password secret is deleted
wip-deploy user remove e2e --name <install>
```

- `--group` is the user's authorization group: `wip-admins`, `wip-editors`,
  `wip-viewers`, or a group an app defines.
- The username names the password secret, so it must start with a letter or
  digit and use only letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`. Emails must be
  unique on the install, because Dex identifies static users by email.
- There is no password-rotate verb. To give a user a fresh password,
  `remove` it and `add` it again.
- `remove` refuses to delete the last `wip-admins` user. Add another admin
  first.
- `user add` and `user remove` re-render the install's files from the
  current repo but apply only to Dex: Dex is recreated with the new user
  set, and every other container keeps running.

Don't hand-edit the rendered Dex `config.yaml` to add users: it is output,
and the next render overwrites it. Don't hand-edit `auth.users` in the
install's `deployment.deployer-state` either: `user add` makes the same
change with validation and generates the password in the same apply.

A dedicated user is the clean way to give an automated test suite (e2e,
Playwright) a browser login. The suite's logins stay separate from real
users', the user can be removed without touching anyone else, and the suite
reads its password from the secret file. A write made with the user's own
OIDC token records its email as `created_by`. A write an app proxies with
its own API key records `apikey:<key-name>` instead, unless the proxy
forwards the user's identity and the receiving service trusts proxy headers.

## 5. Storage and Backup

### 5.1 Default layout

WIP creates a per-service tree under the data directory:

```
<WIP_DATA_DIR>/
├── mongodb/    # MongoDB data files
├── postgres/   # PostgreSQL data files
├── nats/       # NATS JetStream persistence
├── garage/     # Garage object storage
├── dex/        # Dex SQLite + state
└── caddy/      # TLS certificates + runtime config
```

### 5.2 Choosing where data lives

By default the data directory is `<repo-root>/data/`. Override with:

```bash
# Pass to the deployer at install time
wip-deploy install --preset standard --target compose --hostname wip-pi.local \
  --data-dir /mnt/wip-data
```

`WIP_DATA_DIR` is the underlying env var the deployer writes into `.env`. If you want to relocate after the install, stop services, move the tree, update `.env`, and recreate.

### 5.3 Network storage (NFS / GlusterFS / Ceph)

Mount the remote share at `/mnt/wip-data` (or wherever) and use `--data-dir` exactly as above. NFS works well for backup hosts and shared storage. GlusterFS and Ceph are options if you want HA across nodes; they're more involved than this guide covers — your `fstab` for NFS:

```
nas.local:/exports/wip-data  /mnt/wip-data  nfs  defaults,_netdev  0  0
```

### 5.4 Container user mapping (Dex)

Dex runs as UID 1001 inside the container. With rootless podman, the host UID is mapped through the user namespace; the deployer handles this on a fresh install. If you set up storage manually and Dex won't start ("unable to open database file"), set ownership explicitly:

```bash
podman unshare chown 1001:1001 <WIP_DATA_DIR>/dex
podman restart wip-dex
```

Do **not** use `chmod 777` to "fix" permission errors on auth data.

### 5.5 Backup

The recommended quick backup is a stop-and-tar:

```bash
podman stop -a
tar czf wip-backup-"$(date +%Y%m%d)".tar.gz -C "$WIP_DATA_DIR" .
wip-deploy install --preset <your-preset> --target compose --hostname <your-host>   # restart
```

Hot backups for the heavyweights:

```bash
# MongoDB
podman exec wip-mongodb mongodump --out /data/db/backup
cp -r "$WIP_DATA_DIR/mongodb/backup" "./mongodb-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# PostgreSQL
podman exec wip-postgres pg_dump -U wip wip_reporting \
  > "wip-reporting-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql"
```

For offsite storage, encrypt the backup:

```bash
tar czf - "$WIP_DATA_DIR" \
  | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
  > "wip-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz.gpg"
```

### 5.6 Logical export/import — the wip-toolkit CLI

The tar backups above are physical (whole data directory, same platform
version back). For **logical, per-namespace** data management — portable
archives, namespace cloning, scripted/headless workflows — use the
`wip-toolkit` CLI. It is a separate surface from the React Console's
backup/restore (which uses document-store's engine); the CLI is for
headless, scripted, and composable use.

```bash
# Export one namespace to a portable ZIP archive (v3 format;
# multi-namespace archives are supported by the format)
wip-toolkit --proxy export mylab mylab-backup.zip --include-files

# See what an archive contains without touching the instance
wip-toolkit inspect mylab-backup.zip

# Clone into a NEW namespace: fresh mode re-keys every ID and rewrites
# references (documents, files, edges) to the new IDs
wip-toolkit --proxy import mylab-backup.zip --mode fresh \
  --target-namespace mylab-copy

# Both export and import accept --dry-run to preview
```

The full command set: `export`, `import` (fresh/restore modes), `inspect`,
`seed` (bootstrap a namespace from seed files), `status` (§7.4),
`update-document`, `backfill-synonyms`. Each documents its options via
`wip-toolkit <command> --help`.

Scope honesty, so you don't discover limits mid-incident: fresh-mode
import is the verified path for cloning and disaster recovery to a new
namespace. Restore mode (same IDs, original prefix) and full fidelity of
edge-type templates through import have known open defects at the time of
writing — check open cases against the toolkit before relying on either.
There is no point-in-time snapshot (an export captures current state), no
archive merge/diff, and archives do not carry API keys or namespace
grants: a restore brings back data, not access.

## 6. Apps on WIP

WIP is a backend; "apps" are user-facing UIs that talk to it. The deployer has first-class support for installing apps alongside the platform.

### 6.1 The App Contract (v2)

Each managed app has a manifest at `apps/<name>/wip-app.yaml` **in the WIP repo** (not in the app's own source tree) declaring everything the deployer needs to wire it in. The deployer discovers manifests by globbing `<wip-root>/apps/*/wip-app.yaml` — placing one in your app's source repo does nothing. Example (abridged from `apps/react-console/wip-app.yaml`):

```yaml
api_version: wip.dev/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: react-console
  category: optional

spec:
  image:
    name: react-console
    tag: v1.2.2

  ports:
    - {name: http, container_port: 3011}

  env:
    required:
      - {name: WIP_BASE_URL, source: {from_component: router}}
      - {name: WIP_API_KEY,  source: {from_secret: api-key}}
      - {name: PORT,          source: {literal: "3011"}}
      - {name: APP_BASE_PATH, source: {literal: /apps/rc}}
      - {name: NODE_ENV,      source: {literal: production}}

  routes:
    - {path: /apps/rc, auth_required: true}

  depends_on: [document-store]

  healthcheck:
    endpoint: /apps/rc/health
    probe: auto
    start_period_seconds: 15
```

The deployer uses this manifest to:

1. Add the app's container to the generated compose file (or k8s manifest).
2. Generate a Caddy / Ingress route from `routes[].path` to the container port.
3. Wire required env vars from the right sources (`from_component`, `from_secret`, `literal`).
4. Create a Dex OIDC client when `auth_required: true` is set.

> **Legacy v1 contract.** v1 apps shipped a `docker-compose.app.<name>.yml` chunk with `wip.app.*` labels, picked up by `setup-wip.sh`. v2 manifests are the path forward; v1 chunks may still work in older trees but should not be used for new apps.

### 6.2 Auth shape — pick before you implement

WIP supports three distinct authentication shapes for apps. Pick one at design time; switching later means ripping out scaffolding and rebuilding. Two apps in the current constellation made different picks for non-overlapping reasons, and that's fine — what's not fine is picking the wrong shape by drift instead of by decision.

#### Shape A — Gateway-managed (auth-gateway injects `X-WIP-User`)

The auth-gateway terminates OIDC, validates the JWT, and forwards the request to your app with two headers set: `X-WIP-User` (the verified principal) and `X-WIP-Groups` (the user's groups). Your app reads identity from headers; it does not run an OIDC flow, hold sessions, or manage cookies.

- **Manifest:** `routes[].auth_required: true` on every protected route.
- **App env:** `WIP_API_KEY` (or `WIP_API_KEY_FILE`) for outbound API calls. No OIDC client config, no session secret, no cookie config.
- **In WIP today:** react-console.
- **When to pick:** you need per-user authorization but don't need to customize claims handling, session lifetime, profile pages, or the OIDC flow itself.
- **What you give up:** no control over the auth flow. The gateway's verification logic is what it is.

#### Shape B — App-side OIDC (sharing Dex as IdP)

Your app runs its own OIDC client (`express-session` + `openid-client`, or equivalent) and points it at Dex (WIP's IdP). The gateway passes the request through unauthenticated; the app handles login redirects, sessions, cookies, and identity verification itself.

- **Manifest:** `routes[].auth_required: false` (the gateway hands the request to the app; the app gates access via its own session middleware).
- **App env:** `OIDC_ISSUER` (external Dex URL), `OIDC_INTERNAL_ISSUER` (internal Dex URL for localhost), `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET`. Plus `WIP_API_KEY` for outbound platform calls.
- **In WIP today:** WIP-KB (browser-facing routes).
- **When to pick:** you need custom claims handling, custom session lifetime, an in-app login/profile UX, or integration with non-WIP IdPs you've added to Dex's connectors.
- **What you sign up for:** sessions, cookies, the `trust proxy` dance, OIDC `state` parameter discipline, cookie-path-with-trailing-slash — all the gotchas in §6.3 around sessions exist because Shape B is in play.

#### Shape C — API-key only (no user identity)

The app authenticates as a service, not a user. Requests carry `X-API-Key` (or use the file-backed equivalent). There's no session, no cookie, no user binding — every request is "this service did it."

- **Manifest:** either omit `routes` entirely (the app isn't user-facing), or set `routes[].auth_required: false` on the no-user-identity routes.
- **App env:** `WIP_API_KEY` or `WIP_API_KEY_FILE`. Nothing else auth-related.
- **In WIP today:** WIP-KB's askBar NL-query endpoint (talks to the platform via a privileged API key, independent of the session-based user auth on its UI routes); admin scripts; batch importers.
- **When to pick:** your app doesn't have a per-user model. Admin tools, batch processors, system services.
- **What you give up:** audit trail attribution to a user. Every action looks like the service did it. If "who initiated this" matters later, you'll regret it.

#### Decision matrix

| Question | A — Gateway | B — App-side OIDC | C — API-key only |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Does your app need user identity? | yes | yes | no |
| Custom claims / session lifetime / login UX? | no | yes | n/a |
| Integration with non-WIP IdPs (Google, Okta, etc.)? | no | yes | n/a |
| Per-user authorization on routes? | yes | yes | no |
| Will every request look like "the service did it"? | no | no | yes |

#### Failure modes for picking wrong

| Wrong pick | Symptom | Cost to recover |
|---|---|---|
| Shape B when A would have worked | You wired up sessions, cookies, OIDC client, `trust proxy`, the §6.3 gotchas — all for what `X-WIP-User` would have given you for free | Medium: rip out scaffold, switch manifest to `auth_required: true`, replace session middleware with header reads |
| Shape A when you actually need custom claims | You hit a wall when needing to extend the gateway's verification, or wanting non-standard session lifetimes | High: switch to B mid-life; everything Shape A skipped you now have to implement |
| Shape C when you need user identity | Audit logs say "service did it"; can't attribute actions; security review later asks "who" and you can't answer | High: add a session/identity layer onto an app that wasn't designed for one |

#### Combining shapes for different endpoints

An app can run multiple shapes side-by-side; each route in the manifest can declare its own `auth_required` and the app dispatches accordingly. WIP-KB does exactly this: browser-facing routes are Shape B (session cookies, app-side OIDC), while the askBar's `/api/ask` endpoint is Shape C (API key against the platform, no user binding because the question doesn't need one).

If you find yourself wanting to mix, that's fine — but declare each route's intent in the manifest explicitly, and document in your app's README which shape lives where. The shape isn't visible to a reader of `wip-app.yaml` from the outside; making it visible saves the next agent debugging a "why is this route un-protected?" mystery.

#### One pragmatic note

Today's `wip-app.yaml` doesn't carry an explicit `auth_mode` field — Shape A vs B is inferred from `routes[].auth_required` (true → A, false + app-side OIDC env vars → B). That works but it's implicit; a future schema addition may name the shape directly so the deploy-readiness check can verify it. Until then, document the intent in the manifest as a top-level comment so a reader doesn't have to guess.

### 6.3 Gotchas — every one was discovered the hard way

These bit real apps in real deployments. Internalise them before you ship.

**1. Bake `VITE_BASE_PATH` at build time.** Vite resolves asset URLs at build, not run. Forgetting `--build-arg VITE_BASE_PATH=/apps/<slug>/` produces an app whose HTML references `/assets/...` instead of `/apps/<slug>/assets/...`, and the browser shows "Refused to apply style — MIME type text/html" errors. **This is the #1 deployment failure.** The pattern in your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
ARG VITE_BASE_PATH=/
ENV VITE_BASE_PATH=${VITE_BASE_PATH}
RUN npm run build
```

Build with: `podman build --build-arg VITE_BASE_PATH=/apps/<slug>/ -t <image> .`

**2. Internal traffic is HTTP, not HTTPS.** `WIP_BASE_URL` from inside an app container must be `http://wip-caddy:8080`, not `https://wip-caddy:8443`. Caddy's HTTPS listener uses a self-signed cert that Node's fetch / undici rejects even with `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`. The HTTP listener on `:8080` is the right destination for internal hops.

**3. Mount everything under `APP_BASE_PATH`.** Caddy preserves the full path. Your app receives `/apps/<slug>/health`, `/apps/<slug>/auth/callback`, etc. Use:

```typescript
const BASE_PATH = process.env.APP_BASE_PATH || ''
const router = express.Router()
router.get('/health', ...)
router.get('/auth/callback', ...)
app.use(BASE_PATH, router)
```

Do **not** rely on Caddy stripping the prefix. Do **not** hardcode paths.

**4. Sessions behind Caddy.** If your app uses sessions for OIDC:

- `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` — without this Express sees HTTP, not HTTPS, and `Secure` cookies don't go back.
- Cookie path = `<APP_BASE_PATH>/` with trailing slash.
- Use a unique cookie name (e.g., `rc.sid`) so apps on the same host don't collide.

**5. OIDC `state` parameter.** Always include a `state` parameter in the auth request. Dex returns it; `openid-client` / `oauth4webapi` will reject the response without it. Use the library's built-in `authorizationUrl()` rather than constructing the URL manually.

**6. Build args, runtime args, and where each lives.**

| Variable | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_BASE_PATH` | Build time | `--build-arg` in Dockerfile |
| `APP_BASE_PATH` | Runtime | env from manifest |
| `WIP_BASE_URL` | Runtime | env from manifest (`from_component: router`) |
| `WIP_API_KEY` | Runtime | env from manifest (`from_secret: api-key`) |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | Runtime | env (the *external* URL — `https://<hostname>:8443/dex`) |

### 6.4 Common app failures

| Symptom | Probable cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 502 on API calls from the app | TLS error proxying to `https://wip-caddy:8443` | Use `http://wip-caddy:8080` |
| 401 on API calls | `WIP_API_KEY` mismatch / stale | Recreate containers so all read the current secret |
| 404 on static assets ("MIME type text/html" errors) | `VITE_BASE_PATH` not baked at build | Add `ARG`/`ENV` to Dockerfile, rebuild with `--build-arg` |
| OIDC "unexpected state" | `state` parameter missing | Use the OIDC library's `authorizationUrl()` |
| OIDC redirect to wrong app | Callback URL missing base path | Mount auth routes under `APP_BASE_PATH`; do not strip prefix |
| Session lost after Dex redirect | `trust proxy` not set, or wrong cookie path | `app.set('trust proxy', 1)`; cookie path = `<BASE>/` with trailing slash |
| `${VAR}` literal in container | Env var not resolved | Verify the manifest's `env.required` lists the var with a real `source:` |

## 7. Security Hardening

### 7.1 Encryption at rest

Recommendation: **host-level full-disk encryption**. It's the best balance of security, performance, and simplicity.

- **Linux / Pi** — LUKS:
  ```bash
  sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda2
  sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sda2 wip-data
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/wip-data
  sudo mount /dev/mapper/wip-data /mnt/wip-data
  ```
- **macOS** — turn on FileVault (System Settings → Privacy & Security → FileVault).
- **Windows / WSL2** — turn on BitLocker for the system drive.

If host-level encryption isn't possible, the alternatives are weaker but available:

- **Object-store SSE** — server-side encryption for object storage (store-dependent; Garage encrypts via its own layout or disk-level encryption).
- **MongoDB Community** does not support encryption at rest. Either upgrade to Enterprise or rely on host-level encryption.
- **PostgreSQL** has no built-in at-rest encryption. `pgcrypto` does column-level encryption inside the database, with the usual key-management trade-offs.

Encrypt **backups** before they leave the host:

```bash
tar czf - "$WIP_DATA_DIR" \
  | gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
  > backup.tar.gz.gpg
```

### 7.2 Key rotation

Services read their secrets and key files **once, at start**. A rotated key
reaches them only when they restart, and a plain restart is not enough on
every target (a compose `restart` keeps the old environment; on k8s a
`subPath`-mounted file never changes inside a running pod). `wip-deploy`
handles this: every service's rendered definition carries a hash of the
secrets and key files it reads, so a rotation re-applies the install and
restarts exactly the services whose key changed — k8s rolls their pods,
compose recreates their containers, dev recreates everything. Storage
services (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NATS, Garage, Dex) are not restarted this way.

**Three kinds of API key, three procedures:**

| Key | Where it lives | Rotate with |
|---|---|---|
| The install's **master key** (`secrets/api-key`), read by every service and app | install secret | `wip-deploy rotate-key --secret api-key --name <install>` |
| **Declared keys** (`auth.api_keys`, e.g. agent keys) | install secret + rendered `api-keys.json` | `wip-deploy rotate-key <key-name> --name <install>` |
| **Runtime keys** (console / `POST /api/registry/api-keys`) | Registry (MongoDB, bcrypt hash) | revoke + create a new one; other services see the change within the 30 s key sync |

`rotate-key` prints the new plaintext **once**, names the services the apply
restarted, and then probes the install's public URL: the Registry must
accept the new key and refuse the old one, or the command fails (`--no-check`
skips the probe). There is no grace window — once the apply completes, the
old value gets 401.

After rotating:

- Clients that read the key **file** need no config change, but only some
  re-read it while running: `kbc` reads it on every call and follows at once;
  an MCP server configured with `WIP_API_KEY_FILE` reads it once at start, so
  open MCP sessions get 401 until they are reconnected (e.g. `/mcp` in Claude
  Code); app servers using `apiKeyFile` follow on their next restart.
- Anyone holding a **copy** of the key (scripts, other machines, people)
  must be given the new value.
- For zero downtime with external consumers that cannot switch at once,
  declare a second key, apply, move consumers over, then remove the first.

**Not rotatable with `rotate-key`:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL passwords, the
Garage keys and Dex secrets. These also need a change in the store that
uses them (the database keeps its own copy of the password), which
`rotate-key` does not make, so it refuses them. The NATS and MongoDB user
passwords (`nats-password-<service>`, `mongo-password-<client>`) are refused
too. The server and the client read the password only at start (MongoDB
applies a changed one on its next start), and on k8s a changed secret
restarts neither server, so the two would disagree until both restart.

Rotation cadences worth defaulting to:

| Secret | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| API keys | Annually, immediately on compromise | Higher frequency in regulated environments |
| Database passwords | Annually | Coordinate with maintenance window |
| Dex client secret | Annually | Affects active sessions |
| TLS (Let's Encrypt) | Automatic | Caddy renews 30 days before expiry |

### 7.3 Validate before exposing

Run the automated pre-exposure checklist against the install:

```bash
wip-deploy verify --security --name <name>
```

Read-only. It checks secret file permissions (dir 700, files 600), API-key
strength (not the documented dev default, not trivially short), TLS mode vs
hostname sanity, variant vs exposure (a public-shaped install must run
`--variant prod` so the in-service startup guards are armed), published host
ports (no datastore/admin ports bypassing Caddy), and security headers on
public installs. Exit 0 = safe to expose; each failure prints a fix hint.

### 7.4 Ongoing health monitoring

Every WIP service exposes `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/health/integrity`, but in a non-techie deployment nobody is watching them. `wip-toolkit status` aggregates these and exits non-zero on anomalies — wire it to cron + email and the install will tell you when something is wrong:

```cron
*/5 * * * *  /usr/local/bin/wip-toolkit --proxy --host wip.local status --quiet --json | mail -E -s "WIP status alert" you@example.com
```

`mail -E` only sends mail when there is non-empty output, and `--quiet` only prints when overall status is not `ok`. Result: silent unless broken.

For a daily integrity scan (heavier — orphaned terminology / template / term references):

```cron
17 4 * * *  /usr/local/bin/wip-toolkit --proxy --host wip.local status --integrity --quiet --json | mail -E -s "WIP integrity alert" you@example.com
```

| Default threshold | Value | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `events_failed >= N` | 1 | warning |
| `consumer_lag >= N` | 100 | warning |
| `consumer_lag >= N` | 1000 | critical |
| `integrity_drift >= N` | 1 | critical |

Override with `--failed-events-warning`, `--consumer-lag-warning`, `--consumer-lag-critical`.

## 8. MCP Server Setup (AI-assisted development)

WIP ships an MCP server exposing **101 tools and 5 resources** to AI coding assistants. An AI agent can discover templates, query documents, manage terminologies, and import data through tool calls — without reading WIP source code. This section is the operator-side setup; for *what the tools do*, see `docs/mcp-server.md` and the `wip://` resources.

### 8.1 Prerequisites

- WIP services running (you should be able to `curl http://localhost:8001/api/registry/health`)
- Python venv with MCP deps (created by `setup-backend-agent.sh` or your own setup)
- An API key in `.env`

### 8.2 Three transport options

`scripts/setup-backend-agent.sh` configures `.mcp.json` for whichever transport you want.

**Local stdio** — most common, AI agent runs on the same machine as WIP:

```bash
./scripts/setup-backend-agent.sh
```

**SSH proxy** — AI agent on your laptop, WIP on a remote host:

```bash
./scripts/setup-backend-agent.sh --target ssh --host your-wip-host.local
```

This requires SSH key-based auth (no password prompts) and a usable `~/.ssh/config` entry. The MCP server runs on the remote host; SSH stdio handles the transport.

**HTTP transport** — network-exposed MCP, for clients that don't speak SSH stdio or for multi-client setups:

```bash
./scripts/setup-backend-agent.sh --target http --host your-wip-host.local
```

The HTTP listener defaults to `0.0.0.0:8000` (FastMCP default) and is gated by an `API_KEY` env var. If you start it without one, the server runs unauthenticated and prints a warning — fine for a private LAN, dangerous on a public network.

### 8.3 Pointing at the right backend

If your agent is calling WIP through Caddy (the standard deployment), set:

```bash
export WIP_API_URL=https://localhost:8443
export WIP_VERIFY_TLS=false   # only when using a self-signed cert in dev
```

To bypass Caddy and target services directly:

```bash
export REGISTRY_URL=http://your-wip-host.local:8001
export DEF_STORE_URL=http://your-wip-host.local:8002
export TEMPLATE_STORE_URL=http://your-wip-host.local:8003
export DOCUMENT_STORE_URL=http://your-wip-host.local:8004
export REPORTING_SYNC_URL=http://your-wip-host.local:8005
```

### 8.4 SSH connection drops

If using SSH stdio and the connection drops:

- Add `ServerAliveInterval 60` to the host's `~/.ssh/config` entry.
- On the remote (Linux), enable lingering for the user (`loginctl enable-linger`) so the session survives logout.

> **Cloud AI + your data.** WIP stores data locally, but if you use a cloud AI in any role that reads or queries that data, the data leaves your machine — through the AI's development context (sample files), MCP queries, or conversational queries. The fix is a local model speaking the same MCP protocol; until those are capable enough for multi-tool reasoning, treat the trade-off as a conscious choice. See README's "Cloud AI" caution for the full breakdown.

## 9. Common Failure Modes — Fast Diagnosis

| Symptom | Where to look | Likely fix |
|---|---|---|
| 401 after a successful Dex login | The 401's `detail` names the failed check (issuer, audience, expiry); see §3.1 for what each is rendered from | An issuer or audience mismatch means rendered config was hand-edited: `wip-deploy redeploy` |
| 404 on `/api/<svc>/...` calls | §3.2 Caddy `handle` vs `handle_path` | Use `handle`, not `handle_path` |
| Health probe says "200" but the service isn't really up | §3.3 Caddy 200-on-unmatched | Validate by content, not just status code |
| Env change didn't take effect | §7.2 Key rotation | `wip-deploy redeploy --name <install>` (or `podman-compose down && podman-compose up -d`) — a `restart` keeps the old env |
| "unable to open database file" on Dex | §5.4 Container user mapping | `podman unshare chown 1001:1001 <data-dir>/dex` |
| App returns 502 calling WIP from inside its container | §6.3 gotcha 2 | Use `http://wip-caddy:8080`, not `https://wip-caddy:8443` |
| App's static assets return 404 with MIME-type errors | §6.3 gotcha 1 | Bake `VITE_BASE_PATH` at build time with `--build-arg` |
| Non-privileged API key gets 403 on every call | §4.5 Namespace scoping | Add a `namespaces` field; or put the key in `wip-admins` / `wip-services` |
| MongoDB won't start on a network filesystem | §5.3 Network storage | WiredTiger doesn't like some NFS configurations; prefer local storage for MongoDB |
